# Structure

## Jump from _EDOs_ to _PDEs_
* Problem posing with _EDOs_
  - Differentiation is a destructive operation
  - One more derivative = One more unknown
* Two _equal_ equations
* Problem posing with _PDEs_

## Classical _PDEs_
* Derivatives in higher dimensions
  - The _nabla_ operator
* Elliptic equations
  - Electrostatics
  - Aerodynamics
* Parabolic equations
  - Heat
  - Diffusion
  - Diffusion-reaction
  - Fokker-Planck
* Hyperbolic equations
  - Wave

## Boundary conditions
* Intuitive approach
  - Dirichlet
  - Von Neumann

## Numerical approach
* Matlab pdepe
* Matlab PDE Toolbox

## Problems
* Solve a directly integrable _PDE_
  - du/dx = y
* Solve an easy system
  - Solvable: grad u = (y, x + 2y)
  - Not solvable: grad u = (xy, y)
* Find a particular solution of an easy _PDE_
* 2D Potential problem
